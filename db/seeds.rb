# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# puts "cresting test cocktail"
# name = "Test cocktail"
# Cocktail.new(name: name).save

# puts "done"
# puts Cocktail.all


# Dose.create(description: "10cl")
# Dose.create(description: "5cl")
# Dose.create(description: "50cl")
